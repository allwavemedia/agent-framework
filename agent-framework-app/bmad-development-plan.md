# BMad Method Development Plan: AI Workflow Builder

**Project:** AI Workflow Builder  
**Date Created:** October 3, 2025  
**Plan Version:** 1.0  
**Current Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Development Phase

## Executive Summary

This document provides the complete sequential roadmap for developing the AI Workflow Builder using the BMad Method. The planning phase has been completed with all required artifacts. This plan covers the transition from planning to development execution, including specific commands, expected outcomes, and quality checkpoints.

## Phase 0: Discovery, Research & UX Validation (Pre-Build Enablement)

Purpose: Establish validated problem understanding, UX foundations, and feasibility signals before sharding and story drafting. Skip only if a prior validated PRD, UX Spec, and research baseline already exist with no material deltas.

### Step 0.1: Problem & Opportunity Research (Analyst)

**When:** New domain, pivot, unclear user pain, or competitive ambiguity.

**Commands (examples):**

```bash
*agent analyst
*brainstorm "workflow authoring pain points"
*perform-market-research
*create-competitor-analysis
```

**Outputs:** Market/competitor snapshot, clarified user segments & JTBD, refined problem framing feeding Project Brief / PRD goals.

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Primary user segments & top JTBD articulated
- [ ] 3â€“5 differentiators vs. key competitors captured
- [ ] Risks / open questions logged into PRD risks section

### Step 0.2: Experience Modeling & Early UX Architecture (UX Expert)

**When:** Prior to (or parallel with) epic definition; whenever major interaction paradigms are novel.

**Commands:**

```bash
*agent ux-expert
*generate-ui-prompt
```

**Activities:** Core user flows, preliminary IA, component taxonomy (atomic â†’ composite), accessibility intents, responsive breakpoints.

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] MVP happy-path flows mapped
- [ ] Initial component taxonomy drafted
- [ ] Accessibility & responsive constraints noted

### Step 0.3: Feasibility & Constraint Scan (Analyst + Architect as needed)

Identify technical assumptions, integration constraints, performance / scale concerns, and build-vs-buy candidates.

**Outputs:** Assumption list, integration risk notes, flagged high-risk areas for early architecture scrutiny.

### Step 0.4: UX Prompt & Design Asset Generation (Optional)

Use UX Expert to create master AI generation prompt for rapid wireframes / mockups.

**Command:**

```bash
*agent ux-expert
*generate-ui-prompt
```

### Step 0.5: Alignment & Handover

Analyst synthesizes research + UX Expert flows â†’ Product Owner updates PRD Epics & UI/UX Spec; Scrum Master prepares for story drafting. If major uncertainty remains, loop 0.1â€“0.3 selectively.

## Quality Standards & Best Practices

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% for new code
- **Linting:** Zero linting errors before story completion
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript compliance
- **Documentation:** All public APIs documented

### BMad Process Standards
- **Story Isolation:** Each story should be independently completable
- **Quality Gates:** All stories must pass QA review or have documented waivers
- **Version Control:** Commit changes after each completed story
- **Context Management:** Keep architecture files lean and focused

### Specialized Agent Roles

While the core workflow revolves around the PO, SM, Dev, and QA agents, BMad also includes specialized agents for specific tasks. These agents can be invoked as needed to provide expert input.

- **Analyst Agent (`*agent analyst`):** Use this agent for in-depth research, data analysis, and to gain insights into market trends, competitor features, or technical feasibility. This is most valuable during the initial planning and discovery phases.
- **UX-Expert Agent (`*agent ux-expert`):** This agent specializes in user experience and interface design. Use it to refine UI/UX specifications, review wireframes, and ensure the application is intuitive and user-friendly. It is a valuable resource during the design phase and for stories with significant UI components.
