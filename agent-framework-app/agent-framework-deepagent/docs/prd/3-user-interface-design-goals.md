# **3\. User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience will be centered around the "Split Screen" model, providing a seamless, interactive, and educational environment. The design should feel powerful yet intuitive, empowering low-code users while accelerating the workflow for experienced developers. The primary goal is to make the complex process of AI orchestration feel tangible and manageable.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Two-Way Sync:** The core interaction is the real-time, bidirectional synchronization between the visualizer and the code editor. Changes in one are instantly reflected in the other.  
* **Direct Manipulation:** Users should feel like they are directly manipulating the workflow, whether by dragging nodes on a canvas or typing code.  
* **Progressive Disclosure:** The UI should be clean and uncluttered by default, with advanced options and details (like Executor state or event logs) available on demand.

## **Core Screens and Views**

* **Main Workspace View:** The primary split-screen interface. This includes the visualizer pane, the code editor pane, a top-level control bar (Generate, Run, Debug, Save), and a collapsible bottom console panel.  
* **Dashboard / Workflow List:** A simple view where authenticated users can see and manage their saved workflows.

## **Branding**

The branding should be modern, clean, and professional, evoking a sense of intelligence and efficiency. Use a simple color palette with clear primary actions. The visualizer should use distinct colors and shapes to represent different types of Executors or states (e.g., running, success, failed).

## **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

The primary target is a desktop web browser experience, as the complexity of the interface is not well-suited for small mobile screens. The application should, however, be responsive enough to function on tablets.
