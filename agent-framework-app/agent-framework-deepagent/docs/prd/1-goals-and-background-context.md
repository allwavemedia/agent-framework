# **1\. Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

* **Reduce Development Time:** Decrease the time required to build and deploy a functional AI workflow by 50% for Python Developers.  
* **Increase Accessibility:** Enable non-expert users to successfully create and run multi-step AI workflows.  
* **Establish Framework Adherence:** Ensure 100% compliance with Microsoft Agent Framework constructs in all generated code.  
* **Provide Interactive Tooling:** Deliver a seamless, two-way interactive experience between visual workflow design and code generation.  
* **Enable Robust Debugging:** Offer tools for breakpoints, state inspection, and real-time event monitoring.  
* **Support Stateful Execution:** Implement persistence for long-running, pausable, and resumable workflows.

## **Background Context**

This project addresses the high barrier to entry for developing AI agents and workflows, which typically requires deep programming expertise. By creating a web application that translates natural language into framework-compliant Python code, we bridge the gap between high-level conceptual design and low-level implementation. The platform's core "Split Screen" model, featuring an interactive visualizer and a synchronized code editor, aims to democratize AI agent creation for a broader audience while accelerating development for experienced programmers. This PRD outlines the requirements for an ambitious MVP that includes not just code generation but also full interactivity, debugging, and stateful execution from day one.
