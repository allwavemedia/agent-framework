# Story 4.3: Implement Breakpoints & State Inspection

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a user, I want to set breakpoints in my visual workflow and inspect the state when it pauses, so I can debug it. (FR10)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can click on Executor in visualizer to toggle breakpoint.
2. Execution engine pauses at marked Executor in debug mode.
3. Backend receives current workflow state when paused.
4. State displayed in "State" tab in console panel.
5. "Continue" button resumes execution until next breakpoint or completion.

## Dev Notes
- Implement breakpoint toggling in visualizer.
- Execution engine pause/resume logic.
- Backend/state inspection and UI display.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add breakpoint toggle to visualizer.
- [ ] Implement pause/resume in execution engine.
- [ ] Backend receives and displays state.
- [ ] Add "Continue" button to UI.
