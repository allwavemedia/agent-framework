# Story 1.3: Implement Workflow Visualization API

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a developer, I want an API that converts a workflow's Python code into a visual diagram definition, so that it can be rendered on the frontend. (FR2)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An API endpoint POST /api/visualize-workflow is created.
2. It accepts Python code as input.
3. It uses the WorkflowViz class to generate a Mermaid diagram definition string.
4. It returns the Mermaid string in a JSON response.

## Dev Notes
- API must follow OpenAPI spec in `docs/architecture/5-api-specification-openapi-30.md`.
- Use WorkflowViz class for diagram generation.
- Response must include Mermaid diagram string.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create POST /api/visualize-workflow endpoint.
- [ ] Accept Python code as input.
- [ ] Integrate WorkflowViz for diagram generation.
- [ ] Return Mermaid string in response.
- [ ] Document endpoint in OpenAPI spec.

## Project Structure Notes
- Backend API code in `apps/backend/app/`.
- Update OpenAPI documentation.

## Testing
- Backend: pytest for endpoint logic.
- Integration: Test valid/invalid code handling.
