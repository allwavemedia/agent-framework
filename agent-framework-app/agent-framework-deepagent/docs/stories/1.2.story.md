# Story 1.2: Implement NLP to Python Generation API

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a user, I want to submit a text prompt to the application, so that it generates a Python script for an AI workflow. (FR1)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An API endpoint POST /api/generate-workflow is created.
2. It accepts a JSON payload with a prompt field.
3. It uses a meta-agent (ChatClientAgent with structured output) to process the prompt.
4. It returns a JSON response containing the generated Python code as a string.

## Dev Notes
- API must follow OpenAPI spec in `docs/architecture/5-api-specification-openapi-30.md`.
- Use meta-agent for prompt processing.
- Response must include generated Python code as a string.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create POST /api/generate-workflow endpoint.
- [ ] Accept JSON payload with prompt field.
- [ ] Integrate meta-agent for prompt processing.
- [ ] Return generated Python code in response.
- [ ] Document endpoint in OpenAPI spec.

## Project Structure Notes
- Backend API code in `apps/backend/app/`.
- Update OpenAPI documentation.

## Testing
- Backend: pytest for endpoint logic.
- Integration: Test valid/invalid prompt handling.
