# **1\. Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the AI Workflow Builder's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

### **Target User Personas**

* **Low-Code Developer/Non-Expert User:** This user understands the logic of a workflow but is not a professional programmer. They need a highly intuitive visual interface that abstracts away code complexity.  
* **Python Developer:** An experienced programmer who wants to accelerate their workflow. They value efficiency, keyboard shortcuts, and the ability to drop into code for complex logic, but will use the visual tools for speed and clarity.

### **Usability Goals**

* **Ease of Learning:** A new user should be able to generate their first workflow from a natural language prompt within 2 minutes of using the application.  
* **Efficiency of Use:** An expert user should be able to create, test, and save a moderately complex (5-7 node) workflow faster than they could by writing the Python code from scratch.  
* **Error Prevention:** The UI must provide clear feedback and confirmations for destructive actions (e.g., deleting a node). The two-way sync should never result in a syntactically invalid state.  
* **Memorability:** An infrequent user should be able to return to the application after a week and immediately understand how to load and run their saved workflows.

### **Design Principles**

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness:** The state of the workflow must always be clear. The visual diagram is the source of truth for the structure, and the code is the source of truth for the implementation. There should be no ambiguity.  
2. **Two-Way Sync is King:** The core of the experience is the seamless, real-time synchronization between the visual and code editors. This link must feel instantaneous and reliable.  
3. **Progressive Disclosure:** Keep the interface clean. Show core controls by default and reveal advanced options (like breakpoint states or detailed event logs) only when the user actively seeks them.  
4. **Immediate Feedback:** Every user action—be it dragging a node, typing code, or clicking "Run"—must provide an immediate and clear visual response.
