# **3\. Tech Stack**

This is the definitive technology selection for the entire project. All development must use these exact versions.

| Category | Technology | Justification & Framework Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Backend Language** | Python 3.11+ | Required by the prompt and the Microsoft Agent Framework. |
| **Backend Framework** | FastAPI | High-performance, async-native framework ideal for handling WebSockets and long-running agent tasks. |
| **Core AI Framework** | **Microsoft Agent Framework** | The non-negotiable core of the backend. All agent/workflow logic will use its WorkflowBuilder, ChatClientAgent, etc. |
| **Frontend Framework** | React (with TypeScript) | Robust library for building the complex, interactive split-screen UI. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Reliable relational database for storing user accounts, workflow definitions, and serialized AgentThread states for checkpointing. |
| **Code Editor (UI)** | Monaco Editor | Provides a rich, VS Code-like editing experience for Python in the browser. |
| **Workflow Visualizer** | React Flow w/ Mermaid.js | React Flow provides the interactive canvas (drag, drop, connect), while Mermaid.js will render the graph generated by WorkflowViz. |
| **Execution Sandbox** | Docker | Provides essential process, network, and filesystem isolation for running user-generated code securely. |
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry | As specified in the agent-framework.md documentation, for built-in tracing of workflow.run and executor.process spans. |
| **Real-time Comms** | WebSockets | Used for streaming WorkflowEvent data from the backend to the frontend console during execution. |
| **UI Components** | Shadcn/UI & Tailwind CSS | A modern, accessible component library that allows for rapid UI development and easy theming. |
