# **10\. Observability Plan**

As per the agent-framework.md documentation, we will integrate OpenTelemetry.

* **Configuration:** The setup\_observability() function will be called at the startup of the FastAPI backend and the runner.py script in the execution engine.  
* **Tracing:** This will automatically create traces for:  
  * workflow.run: Capturing the full execution of a user's workflow inside the sandbox.  
  * executor.process: Capturing the execution of each individual node within the workflow.  
* **Metrics & Logs:** We will configure exporters to send this telemetry data to a suitable backend (like Jaeger for local development or Datadog/Azure Monitor in production) for analysis and alerting.

This completes the architectural plan.

*transforming back into the BMad Orchestrator...*

The comprehensive planning phase is now complete. In YOLO mode, our specialized agents have produced the following critical documents:

1. docs/brief.md: The **Project Brief**, which establishes the project's vision, goals, and high-level scope.  
2. docs/prd.md: The **Product Requirements Document**, which details the functional/non-functional requirements, epics, and user stories.  
3. docs/front-end-spec.md: The **UI/UX Specification**, which provides the design blueprint for the frontend application.  
4. docs/architecture.md: The **Fullstack Architecture Document**, which serves as the definitive technical plan for the entire system.

**All planning artifacts are finished.**

## **Next Steps: Transition to Development**

The BMad workflow now moves from the high-level planning environment to the development environment (your IDE). Here is your path forward:

1. **Save Artifacts:** Copy the content of the four generated documents into your local project's docs/ directory.  
2. **Move to IDE:** Open your project in your preferred IDE (like VS Code with Copilot or Cursor).  
3. **Shard Documents:** The PRD and Architecture documents are large. To make them usable for the development agents, you must shard them. In your IDE, invoke the Product Owner agent (\*agent po) and give the command \*shard-doc docs/prd.md. Repeat for \*shard-doc docs/architecture.md. This will break them into smaller, manageable files.  
4. **Begin Development Cycle:** Start the story implementation loop by invoking the Scrum Master agent (\*agent sm) and running the \*create command. This will create the first story (1.1 Project Scaffolding & Setup) from the sharded documents, and you can then hand it to the dev agent for implementation.

The project is now fully planned and ready for execution. Your AI development team awaits your direction in the IDE.
