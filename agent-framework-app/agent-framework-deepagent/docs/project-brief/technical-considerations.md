# **Technical Considerations**

* **Platform Requirements:** The application must be a web-based SPA accessible via modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). The backend must be horizontally scalable to handle numerous concurrent workflow executions.  
* **Technology Preferences:**  
  * **Frontend:** React (with TypeScript) for a robust, component-based architecture.  
  * **Backend:** Python with FastAPI for high-performance, async API endpoints.  
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL for reliable, structured data storage.  
  * **Execution Sandbox:** Docker for secure, isolated code execution.  
* **Architecture Considerations:** A real-time communication channel (WebSockets) is mandatory between the frontend and backend to support interactive editing, code synchronization, and live debugging event streams. The architecture must separate the core web application from the workflow execution engine.
