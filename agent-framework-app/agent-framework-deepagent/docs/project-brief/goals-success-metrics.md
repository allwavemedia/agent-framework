# **Goals & Success Metrics**

## **Business Objectives**

* **Reduce Development Time:** Decrease the time required to build and deploy a functional AI workflow by 50% for Python Developers compared to writing framework code from scratch.  
* **Increase Accessibility:** Enable 1,000 Low-Code Developers to successfully create and run a multi-step workflow within the first six months post-launch.  
* **Establish Framework Adherence:** Achieve 100% compliance with Microsoft Agent Framework constructs in all generated code, ensuring portability and correctness.

## **User Success Metrics**

* **Ease of Use (Low-Code User):** 80% of new low-code users can successfully generate and execute a simple two-agent workflow from a natural language prompt within 10 minutes of their first session.  
* **Efficiency (Python Developer):** Python developers report a 70% or higher satisfaction rate with the code scaffolding feature, citing significant time savings.  
* **Confidence:** A user survey indicates that 75% of users feel confident understanding and debugging their workflows using the split-screen UI and event logs.

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

* **Workflow Generation Success Rate:** 95% of natural language prompts result in valid, executable Python code.  
* **Active Users:** Achieve 500 weekly active users within the first quarter.  
* **User Retention:** Achieve a 30% week-4 retention rate for new users.  
* **Session-to-Execution Ratio:** 60% of user sessions result in at least one workflow execution.
