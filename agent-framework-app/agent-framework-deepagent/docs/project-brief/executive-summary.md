# **Executive Summary**

This project will create a web application that enables users to build, manage, and execute AI agents and multi-step workflows using natural language. The platform translates user intent into executable Python code compliant with the Microsoft Agent Framework, featuring a dual-pane UI with a visual workflow diagram and a corresponding code editor. The primary goal is to democratize AI agent creation for both technical and non-technical users by abstracting the complexity of the underlying framework.
