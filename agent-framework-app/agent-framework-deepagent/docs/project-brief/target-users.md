# **Target Users**

## **Primary User Segment: The Low-Code Developer / Power User**

* **Profile:** Business analysts, data scientists, product managers, and hobbyist developers who are technically proficient and understand logic, but are not expert Python programmers.  
* **Behaviors:** They are comfortable with visual builders, node-based editors (like Zapier or Make), and using natural language to express intent. They want to build powerful AI automations without writing boilerplate code or managing complex development environments.  
* **Needs & Pain Points:** They are frustrated by the limitations of purely no-code platforms but intimidated by the steep learning curve of coding-intensive AI frameworks. They need a tool that lets them design complex logic visually and then "drop down" into code only when necessary.

## **Secondary User Segment: The Python Developer**

* **Profile:** Experienced software developers who are familiar with Python and are either new to the Microsoft Agent Framework or want to accelerate their development process.  
* **Behaviors:** They are comfortable writing code and using IDEs. They value tools that reduce boilerplate, enforce best practices, and provide a clear starting point. They will primarily use the code editor but appreciate the visualizer for understanding, debugging, and communicating workflow structures to less technical colleagues.  
* **Needs & Pain Points:** Their main challenge is the time it takes to learn and correctly implement the specific constructs of the Agent Framework (Workflows, Executors, Edges). They need a tool that can quickly scaffold framework-compliant code from a high-level description, allowing them to focus on refining the core logic rather than setting up the structure.
