## üö® Troubleshooting

**If DevUI isn't responding:**
1. Check terminal - is server still running?
2. Refresh browser page
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify http://localhost:8080/health returns OK

**If responses are slow:**
1. Check OpenAI API status
2. Look for rate limiting messages
3. Try simpler queries first

**If context is lost:**
1. This is expected for very long conversations
2. Start a new conversation thread
3. Be more concise in queries

**Pro Tip**: Open browser DevTools (F12) to monitor network requests and see any errors in real-time!
