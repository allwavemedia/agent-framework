## üîç Validation Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] **Response Time**: Responses arrive within reasonable time (< 5 seconds for simple queries)
- [ ] **Coherence**: Responses are well-structured and make sense
- [ ] **Context Retention**: Agent remembers earlier conversation parts
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unclear or problematic inputs
- [ ] **Formatting**: Proper use of markdown, lists, code blocks where appropriate
- [ ] **Completeness**: Multi-part questions get multi-part answers
- [ ] **Technical Accuracy**: Information about Agent Framework is correct
- [ ] **UI Responsiveness**: DevUI interface remains responsive during interactions
- [ ] **Streaming**: Text appears progressively (streaming response)
- [ ] **Visual Elements**: Check if DevUI shows message history, typing indicators, etc.

---

## üêû Known Issues to Watch For

Monitor for these potential problems:

1. **Token Limits**: Very long conversations may hit context limits
2. **API Rate Limits**: Rapid successive queries might trigger rate limiting
3. **Timeout Issues**: Complex queries taking too long to respond
4. **Memory Issues**: Agent forgetting earlier context
5. **UI Freezing**: Browser becoming unresponsive during long responses
6. **WebSocket Disconnections**: Connection drops during streaming

---

## üìä Performance Metrics to Track

While testing, note:

- **First Response Time**: Time to first token
- **Complete Response Time**: Total time to finish response
- **Response Quality**: Subjective rating (1-5)
- **Context Accuracy**: Did it remember previous inputs?
- **Error Rate**: How many queries resulted in errors?

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

The test is successful if:

‚úÖ Agent responds to all test scenarios  
‚úÖ Maintains context across conversation  
‚úÖ Provides relevant, helpful responses  
‚úÖ DevUI interface remains stable  
‚úÖ Streaming functionality works smoothly  
‚úÖ No major errors or crashes  
‚úÖ Response times are acceptable  

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

Once you've completed these tests:

1. **Document Issues**: Note any problems encountered
2. **Test Custom Agents**: Try creating your own agent configurations
3. **Test Workflows**: If workflow support is available, test workflow execution
4. **API Testing**: Use the API endpoints directly (see below)
5. **Performance Testing**: Try stress testing with multiple rapid queries

---

## üîß API Testing (Optional)

You can also test the DevUI API directly:

### Get Entities List
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/entities
```

### Send Message to Agent
```powershell
$body = @{
    model = "agent-framework"
    input = "Hello, this is an API test!"
    extra_body = @{
        entity_id = "agent_in-memory_testagent_1bb5eb18"
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/v1/responses" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

### Health Check
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## üí° Tips for Effective Testing

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic queries before complex ones
2. **Take Notes**: Document interesting responses or issues
3. **Vary Input Style**: Try questions, commands, scenarios
4. **Test Boundaries**: Push the limits to find breaking points
5. **Check UI Elements**: Don't just focus on responses, check the entire interface
6. **Monitor Console**: Keep browser developer console open for errors
7. **Compare with Expectations**: Does behavior match documentation?
