## 🎓 Documentation Best Practices Applied

### 1. Single Source of Truth ✅

Each topic now has ONE authoritative source:
- **Provider setup** → PROVIDER_SETUP.md
- **Implementation** → IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md  
- **Quick reference** → QUICKSTART.md
- **Questions** → FAQ.md
- **Navigation** → README.md

### 2. Clear Hierarchy ✅

```
README.md → "What is this? Where do I start?"
  ↓
QUICKSTART.md → "Get started in 5 minutes"
  ↓
PROVIDER_SETUP.md → "Configure my environment"
  ↓
IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md → "Build features"
  ↓
FAQ.md → "Common questions"
```

### 3. Deprecation Process ✅

- Old Azure-only files deleted (not archived) - they were incorrect
- Research and analysis files moved to archives/ - they're historical
- Backend status moved to main docs/ - better location

### 4. Version Control ✅

All files now have:
- Version number (3.0)
- Last updated date (October 7, 2025)
- Status indicator (✅ READY)
