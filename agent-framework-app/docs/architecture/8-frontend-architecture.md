# **8\. Frontend Architecture**

* **Component Architecture:** The UI will be built with functional React components and hooks. A feature-sliced directory structure will be used to organize logic.  
* **State Management:** For managing the complex state of the editor, visualizer, and console, a robust state management library like **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** will be used. This is essential for handling the real-time two-way sync.  
* **API Integration:** An API client service will be created to handle all communication with the backend. It will use fetch or axios for REST calls and the native WebSocket API for real-time event streaming.
