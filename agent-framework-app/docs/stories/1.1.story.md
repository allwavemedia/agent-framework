# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Setup

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a developer, I want a complete monorepo structure with frontend and backend applications set up, so that I can begin development efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is initialized.
2. A basic "Hello World" React application is created in the `apps/frontend` directory.
3. A basic "Hello World" FastAPI application is created in the `apps/backend` directory.
4. Both applications can be started with a single `npm run dev` command from the root.
5. Docker Desktop (or compatible engine) installation is verified locally (version logged).
6. Required language runtimes are verified: **Node.js LTS version** and **Python 3.11+** (version outputs recorded).
7. A `.env.example` file is created listing all baseline environment variables (placeholders only).
8. README local setup section includes: prerequisites, install, bootstrap, run, test, lint steps.
9. Initial database container/service (PostgreSQL) is provisioned via Docker Compose and reachable from backend service.
10. A database migration tool is selected and initialized (e.g., Alembic for Python) with an empty baseline migration.

## Dev Notes
- Monorepo structure must follow unified project structure from architecture docs.
- Use Node.js LTS and Python 3.11+ as minimum versions.
- Docker Compose config for PostgreSQL and backend service required.
- Alembic migration tool for Python backend.
- `.env.example` must include all required environment variables for local dev.
- README must document all setup steps for onboarding.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize monorepo structure (`apps/frontend`, `apps/backend`, shared config).
- [ ] Scaffold React app in `apps/frontend`.
- [ ] Scaffold FastAPI app in `apps/backend`.
- [ ] Create unified `npm run dev` script to start both apps.
- [ ] Verify Docker Desktop installation and log version.
- [ ] Verify Node.js and Python versions, log outputs.
- [ ] Create `.env.example` with all baseline variables.
- [ ] Provision PostgreSQL via Docker Compose, verify backend connectivity.
- [ ] Initialize Alembic migration tool with baseline migration.
- [ ] Update README with setup, run, test, lint instructions.

## Project Structure Notes
- Follow `docs/architecture/6-unified-project-structure-monorepo.md` for directory layout.
- All new files must be listed in the File List section after implementation.

## Testing
- Backend: pytest for unit/integration tests.
- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library for unit tests.
- Integration: Docker Compose for service orchestration.
