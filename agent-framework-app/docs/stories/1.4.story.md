# Story 1.4: Build Core UI Layout

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a user, I want to see a split-screen layout with a placeholder for the visual diagram and a code editor, so that I can interact with the core features. (FR2, FR3)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The main UI displays a left pane for the visualizer and a right pane with an embedded Monaco code editor.
2. A text input field and a "Generate" button are present.
3. Pressing "Generate" calls the /api/generate-workflow endpoint and displays the returned code in the editor.
4. The generated code is then sent to the /api/visualize-workflow endpoint, and the returned Mermaid definition is rendered in the left pane.

## Dev Notes
- UI must follow design system and layout from UI/UX specification.
- Integrate Monaco code editor and visualizer pane.
- Implement "Generate" button and input field.
- Wire up API calls for code generation and visualization.
