# Story 1.5: Implement Secure Execution Engine

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a developer, I want a secure sandbox to execute user-provided Python code, so that workflows can be run without risk to the system. (FR8)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Docker image is created with Python and agent-framework installed.
2. An internal API is created on the backend that accepts Python code.
3. The API spins up a new, isolated Docker container to run the code.
4. The container has networking disabled and strict CPU/memory limits.
5. Standard output and errors from the script are captured and returned.

## Dev Notes
- Create Docker image with Python and agent-framework.
- Backend API for code execution in isolated container.
- Enforce resource limits and disable networking.
- Capture and return output/errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build Docker image with Python and agent-framework.
- [ ] Create backend API for code execution.
- [ ] Implement container isolation and resource limits.
- [ ] Capture and return output/errors.

## Project Structure Notes
- Backend code in `apps/backend/app/`.
- Dockerfile and compose config in project root.

## Testing
- Backend: pytest for API and container logic.
- Security: Validate isolation and resource limits.
