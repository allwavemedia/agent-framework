# Story 4.1: Implement Workflow Checkpointing

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a developer, I want the system to automatically save the state of a running workflow, so that it can be resumed later. (FR13)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Secure Execution Engine configured with persistent CheckpointManager.
2. Workflow state saved at end of each superstep.
3. Backend stores reference to latest checkpoint ID for execution.
4. State persists across application restarts (NFR4).

## Dev Notes
- Implement CheckpointManager for Secure Execution Engine.
- Persist workflow state reliably.
- Store checkpoint references in backend.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Configure CheckpointManager in Secure Execution Engine.
- [ ] Save workflow state at superstep end.
- [ ] Store checkpoint ID in backend.
- [ ] Ensure state persists across restarts.

## Project Structure Notes
- Backend: `apps/backend/app/`
- Update architecture docs and README.

## Testing
- Backend: pytest for checkpoint logic.
- Integration: Test state persistence.
