# Story 1.6: Implement Real-time Event Streaming

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a user, I want to see real-time events from my workflow execution in a console, so that I can understand its progress. (FR9)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A WebSocket connection is established between the frontend and backend when a workflow is executed.
2. The Secure Execution Engine streams WorkflowEvent data back to the backend.
3. The backend forwards these events over the WebSocket to the frontend.
4. A collapsible console in the UI displays a formatted log of incoming events.

## Dev Notes
- Implement WebSocket connection for workflow execution events.
- Backend streams WorkflowEvent data.
- Frontend displays events in collapsible console.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Establish WebSocket connection for workflow execution.
- [ ] Stream WorkflowEvent data from backend to frontend.
