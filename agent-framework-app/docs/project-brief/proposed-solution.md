# **Proposed Solution**

We propose a "Split Screen" web application that translates natural language descriptions into functional AI agents and workflows. The left pane will display an interactive, visual representation of the workflow graph (Executors and Edges), while the right pane shows the auto-generated, framework-compliant Python code. Users can edit either the visual diagram or the code, with changes reflected in the other pane. The application will provide a secure, sandboxed environment to test and run these workflows, with real-time feedback and debugging information surfaced directly in the UI. This solution directly addresses the problem by providing a user-friendly abstraction that does not sacrifice the power or compliance of the underlying Microsoft Agent Framework.
