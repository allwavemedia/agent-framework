# **6\. Branding & Style Guide**

* **Visual Identity:** The style should be minimalist, professional, and tech-focused. A dark mode will be the default to reduce eye strain for developers.  
* **Color Palette:**  
  * **Primary:** A bright, energetic color for primary actions (e.g., a vibrant blue or purple).  
  * **Background:** A very dark grey/charcoal.  
  * **Text:** Off-white.  
  * **Accents:** Specific colors for diagram nodes based on status: Green (Success), Yellow (Running), Red (Failed).  
* **Typography:** A clean, legible sans-serif font (like Inter) for UI elements and a monospaced font (like Fira Code or JetBrains Mono) for the code editor.
