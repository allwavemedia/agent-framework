# **7\. Accessibility & Responsiveness**

* **Compliance Target:** The application will aim for **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance. All components from the chosen library must be fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers.  
* **Responsiveness:** The primary target is desktop. The application will be usable on tablets, where the split-pane layout will adjust. On mobile, the interface will likely switch to a tabbed view (showing either the visualizer or the code, not both at once) for viewing purposes, as editing would be impractical.
